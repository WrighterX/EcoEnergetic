First let's set up the database. I will be using PostgreSQL, in particular psql:
<img width="1473" height="896" alt="{FBDEE11E-7CCF-4F59-AB46-65050A0B2C3E}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24422105-fe95-48a1-8ca2-87d7d04f4eec" />
As you see we created a database. Now we can choose it and see what's inside it:
<img width="1469" height="442" alt="{79C43A10-19FD-4115-8D06-7E4E683CA47E}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb03276-300a-4727-ae1e-80d777e8ef0d" />
That's right, absolutely nothing - 'Did not find any relations' means the database is empty.
